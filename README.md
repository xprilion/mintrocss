# MintroCSS

**Tagline:** Minimal Retro CSS stylings for your web pages

MintroCSS is a minimal, retro-inspired CSS library designed to provide a clean, vintage aesthetic with modern touches for your web pages. It applies most styles directly to HTML elements, ensuring that any page using the library automatically gains a consistent, attractive look without the need for extensive class-based customization.

## Features

- **Minimal & Lightweight**: Focus on simplicity, reducing the need for extra classes and keeping the CSS lightweight.
- **Retro Aesthetic**: Monospace fonts, dashed underlines, and classic border styles evoke a retro feel.
- **Modern Enhancements**: Subtle animations, responsive design, and modern CSS properties ensure a polished look.
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Built-in responsive adjustments for different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent appearance on mobile devices.

## Quick Start

Add MintroCSS to your HTML file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://xprilion.com/mintrocss/mintro.css">
```

Or clone the repository and use the CSS directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xprilion/mintrocss.git
```

Then, link to `mintro.css` in your HTML file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/mintro.css">
```

## Usage

MintroCSS applies styles directly to standard HTML elements (e.g., `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<a>`, `<button>`), so your page automatically adopts the aesthetic without needing to add additional classes. Customize your web pages effortlessly while keeping the code minimal.

### Example

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>MintroCSS Demo</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://xprilion.com/mintrocss/mintro.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Welcome to MintroCSS</h1>
        <p>This is a minimal, retro-style CSS library for your web projects.</p>
        <a href="#">Learn more</a>
        <footer>Â© 2024 MintroCSS</footer>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

## Customization

While MintroCSS is designed to work out-of-the-box, you can easily override styles in your own stylesheet if you need more customization:

```css
body {
  background-color: #222;
  color: #eee;
}

button {
  background-color: #444;
}
```
